# R Coding Task

# Instructions:

# 1. Use the `rquizdata.csv` file and read the data into a data frame. (1 mark)
# Hint: You can use the `read.table()` or `read.csv()` function.
# Your code here for Task 1


# 2. Display the first 5 rows and the last 3 rows of the data frame. (1 mark)
# Your code here for Task 2


# 3. Add a new column to the data frame called `fullname` that concatenates `firstname` and `lastname` 
# with a space in between. (1 mark)
# Hint: Use the `paste()` function to concatenate strings.
# Your code here for Task 3


# 4. Add a new column to the data frame called `management` that assigns the value "Y" if the person 
# has a salary greater than 50,000 and is older than 45, otherwise assign "N". Print the first 5 rows 
# again to show the updated data frame. (1 mark)
# Hint: Use the `ifelse()` function to assign values based on a condition.
# Your code here for Task 4


# 5. Calculate and print the average age and the maximum salary. (1 mark)
# Your code here for Task 5


# 6. Calculate and print the average salary for females and males. (1 mark)
# Hint: You can use one of the functions: `apply(), tapply(), lapply(), sapply(), and mapply()` .
# Your code here for Task 6


# 7. Display a bar chart showing the number of females and males. (1 mark)
# Note: Use `ggplot2` and `geom_bar()` for the chart, but any charting library is acceptable.
# Your code here for Task 7


# 8. Print the people who earn less than $35,000 or are younger than 21. (1 mark)
# Your code here for Task 8


# 9. Create boxplots to visualize the salary distribution for females and males. (1 mark)
# Note: Use `ggplot2` and `geom_boxplot()` for the chart, but any charting library is acceptable.
# Your code here for Task 9


# 10. Create a function called `buildVector` that takes a number `n` as a parameter and builds and 
# returns a vector with the numbers from 1 to `n`. Test your function for values `n = 3` and `n = 7` 
# and print out the returned vector. (1 mark)
# Your code here for Task 10
